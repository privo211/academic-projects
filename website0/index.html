        <p>This shot was taken in the afternoon when we were taking a stroll into the deep forest and saw this huge magnificent Male taking a nap. He had a kill in the morning and was sufficed and resting. He was a Big Headed Lion commonly known as the 'Dalamathha'. Being so near to him we could feel the fear and energy which was spread all around him, being on foot and having nothing in our hands for defense we were really frightened but at the same time were so mind blown seeing a creature like this so near in its own habitat in his majesticity not bothering about us at all and enjoying the gleam sunshine.

        This shot was a really tough one for me I had my camera in the sports mode.(so that I can capture it's movements as fast as I can and there was no faster way for me to change the settings) I was struggling with the branches of the bushes that were all around me and taking a good angle for my shot and trying that the camera focuses the lion through the many many bushes. I just fired the camera and got this shot which is definitely not a pose but a part of the stretch roll (that maybe he thought to do for me) that the lion did and got me this beautiful image.
